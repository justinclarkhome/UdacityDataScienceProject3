# UdacityDataScienceProject3

This repo is a holder for the third project in the Udacity Data Science namodegree program. The core notebook and data is provided by Udacity, and I downloaded to work on outside the Udacity web interface. An HTML rendering of the notebook is also included in the root of the repo.

A requirements.txt file is included in the repo to allow pip installation of the required libaries. Please open that file to see the specific requirements and additional information.

Ackowledgements: thank you to the Udacity instructors, as the course work was informative and allowed me to build out the solutions contained here.
