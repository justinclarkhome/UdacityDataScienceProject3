# UdacityDataScienceProject3

This repo is a holder for the third project in the Udacity Data Science namodegree program. The core notebook and data is provided by Udacity, and I downloaded to work on outside the Udacity web interface. An HTML rendering of the notebook is also included in the root of the repo.

The only dependencies are Python3 along with Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.

Ackowledgements: thank you to the Udacity instructors, as the course work was informative and allowed me to build out the solutions contained here.
